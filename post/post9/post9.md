####Day 4 -- Lake Louise Area
Since we have climbed Plains of Six Glaciers yesterday, so we need to arrange a trip around lake Louise. After carefully consideration, we picked Mt Fairview

[Fairview Mountain](http://www.soistheman.com/diary/page.php?id=fairview-mtn&page=1)

* Location: Banff National Park (Lake Louise)
* Height: 2,744 m (9,003 ft)
* Elevation Gain: 970 m (3,183 ft)
* Distance: around 10 miles
* Avg Steepness: 11.4Â°
* Estimated Time: 3.5-6 hrs
* Technicality: Intermediate
* Fitness Level: Moderate

The Elevation gain is round 3300ft(1000m), which is not too bad considering that we have a lot of mountain hiking experience (Mt. Washington, Mt Marcy etc.)

From the map above, you can see the relative locations of Fairview and valley of the six glaciers. You can have a good overview of the whole valley and the surrounding mountains.

On the way to the top, you can still see patches of snow there.

As you go higher, you will notice the receding tree line and the last mile is entirely brushes and rocks. It is a bit steep but totally manageable even if you don't have too much hiking experience.

Pano view of the mountains, definitely breathtaking!. Considering this is a fairly moderate trail, I strongly suggest you take this route next time you visit Banff.
