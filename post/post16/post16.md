Today I committed a modifed version of Python-Markdown. Previously, this pip library only supports fenced block at document root level. It is quite inconvenient as often times, we need to nest a code blog inside an ordered list. You can check my [previous post](http://blog.tripplan.info/blog/post/item/14) for a demo.

The code can be checked out from [https://github.com/evertqin/Python-Markdown](https://github.com/evertqin/Python-Markdown).
