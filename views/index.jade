            | I am a converted software developer from a biomedical field. Althougth I am not unfamaliar with programming when I was in school.
            | The choices of programming languages were primarily high level descriptive ones such as MATLAB, R even LabView.
            | I started serious programming since I joined Bloomberg early 2012. We had a four-month intensive UNIX, C/C++ and JavaScript training, 
            | as long as some basical CS background knowledge. 
          p 
            | I spent most of my time writing C++ and XSLT the first few years. Before I left Bloomberg, I did a bit coding in JAVA, mainly used 
            | Java 6 in combination with Spring xml based IOC. I wrote a lot of XML parsers with Python using lxml libary. I also maintained a 
            | very chaotic string parsing library.
          p  
            | After I left Bloomberg and joined the current company, I spend most of my time building a discimination analysis
            | library for animal test in C# and C++. Recently, I devote a good chunk of my time doing full stack development. 
            | My day job is to develop a ASP.NET based numerical analysis software for internal and some external clients. 
            | The website is built on a legacy Webform application which pulls data from varioius WCF servies. I am mainly working on unifying and 
            | replacing the WCF services. Also, I am developing a library for real-time data visualization using several open source JavaScript libraries
            | such as d3.js, three.js, etc.
